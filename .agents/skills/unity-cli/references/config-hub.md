# Config & Hub — unity-cli command reference

Part of the **`unity-cli`** skill. See that skill's `SKILL.md` for CLI install, global flags,
environment variables, exit codes, and common workflows. All global flags (`--format json`,
`--non-interactive`, `--yes`, `--proxy`, …) apply to every command below.

---

### Config — persisted CLI configuration

The `config` command group manages settings that persist across invocations.

#### config proxy

View or change the configured HTTP/HTTPS/SOCKS/PAC proxy. The persisted value is read by every CLI command that issues outbound HTTP (releases, install, auth, telemetry, etc.).

```bash
# Show the effective proxy configuration (resolution source + auth source)
unity config proxy
unity config proxy --json

# Persist a proxy URL
unity config proxy http://proxy.example.com:8080

# Embedded userinfo (user:password@host) is supported and redacted in echo
# output, but prefer leaving credentials out of the URL — the CLI looks them
# up in the OS keyring instead (see Resolution priority below).

# Persist with bypass list (hosts that should NOT go through the proxy)
unity config proxy http://proxy.example.com:8080 --bypass "localhost,127.0.0.1,*.internal"

# SOCKS / PAC variants
unity config proxy socks5://proxy.example.com:1080
unity config proxy pac+http://wpad.example.com/proxy.pac
unity config proxy pac+file:///etc/proxy.pac

# Clear the persisted proxy
unity config proxy --unset
```

**Supported schemes:** `http://`, `https://`, `socks://`, `socks4://`, `socks4a://`, `socks5://`, `socks5h://`, `pac+http://`, `pac+https://`, `pac+file://`.

**Resolution priority** (highest → lowest):
1. `--proxy <url>` global flag (one-shot override for the current invocation)
2. `UNITY_PROXY` env var
3. Standard env vars: `HTTPS_PROXY`, `HTTP_PROXY`, `ALL_PROXY`, `NO_PROXY`
4. Persisted `proxy.json` (`unity config proxy <url>`)
5. System proxy settings (where supported)

Credentials missing from the URL are looked up in the OS keyring (shared with the GUI Hub); Kerberos/SPNEGO-authenticated proxies are supported. `--proxy-disable` short-circuits all of the above for the current invocation, which is the recommended way to diagnose a misconfigured proxy without clearing it.

#### config update-check

New in `0.1.0-beta.8`. Enable or disable the background check for a newer CLI version (the unobtrusive "update available" notice; interactive sessions only, never delays a command). Equivalent to the `UNITY_NO_UPDATE_CHECK` env var.

```bash
unity config update-check          # show the current setting
unity config update-check off      # disable
unity config update-check on       # enable
unity config update-check --json
```

#### config accelerator

View or change the [Unity Accelerator](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UnityAccelerator.html) (asset-import cache server) endpoint. Once persisted, `unity run`, `unity test` and `unity build` inject it into the Editor automatically — see [build-run-test.md](build-run-test.md).

```bash
# Show the resolved endpoint and its source
unity config accelerator
unity config accelerator --json

# Persist an endpoint
unity config accelerator cache.example.com:10080

# A bare host defaults to port 10080 (the Accelerator default)
unity config accelerator cache.example.com

# Clear the persisted endpoint (reports whether there was anything to clear)
unity config accelerator --unset
```

**The value is `host:port`, not a URL.** A scheme is rejected rather than stripped (`http://cache.example.com:10080` fails with exit 6), because `-cacheServerEndpoint` takes a host and a port — persisting a URL would produce a silent non-connection later. IPv6 literals are bracketed: `[::1]:10080`.

**Resolution priority** (highest → lowest):
1. `--accelerator <host:port>` — accepted only on `run` / `test` / `build`, after the command name (one-shot override for that invocation)
2. `UNITY_ACCELERATOR` env var
3. Persisted `accelerator.json` (`unity config accelerator <host:port>`)
4. None

The reported source is one of `flag`, `env`, `settings`, `none`. The env var and the persisted file are resolved on **every** command, which is why `unity diagnose accelerator` can report them; only the flag is scoped to the three commands that inject. A malformed higher-priority candidate is skipped rather than fatal — except an explicit `--accelerator`, which fails as a usage error (exit 2) instead of silently falling through.

`unity config accelerator` with no argument reports the `env` → `settings` → `none` view of persistent configuration. Use `unity diagnose accelerator` (see [diagnostics-maintenance.md](diagnostics-maintenance.md)) for the same resolution plus project settings and reachability. Neither command accepts `--accelerator`, so to see what a one-shot override resolves to, pass it to the `run` / `test` / `build` invocation that uses it.

**A configured endpoint is not always enough.** Every `-cacheServer*` argument overrides *Editor Preferences*, not Project Settings, and `ProjectSettings/EditorSettings.asset`'s `m_CacheServerMode` decides whether preferences are consulted at all. A project set to `Disabled` (mode `2`) ignores the injected flags; the CLI warns when it sees that. Full explanation: `apps/cli/docs/accelerator.md`.

### config get / set / list / unset — read or write any setting by key

A generic key-value interface over the same persisted settings the purpose-built subcommands above already manage — read or write one by name instead of having to know its dedicated command.

```bash
# Every configuration key and its resolved value
unity config list
unity config list --format json

# Read one key
unity config get proxy

# Write one key (validated the same way its dedicated command would validate it)
unity config set accelerator cache.example.com:10080
unity config set update-check off

# Clear one back to its default
unity config unset proxy.bypass
```

Recognized keys, and what they back onto:

| Key | Same as | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `proxy` | `unity config proxy <url>` | Secret-shaped values are redacted on read/echo (`http://***:***@host`) — the real value is still stored and used. |
| `proxy.bypass` | `unity config proxy <url> --bypass <hosts>` | Comma-separated hosts; writing/clearing it leaves the sibling `proxy` key untouched. |
| `accelerator` | `unity config accelerator <endpoint>` | Normalized to `host:port` on write. |
| `update-check` | `unity config update-check on\|off` | Value is `on`/`off`. |

An unknown key, a read-only key (none exist yet — the mechanism exists for a future resolved-only value), or an invalid value for a writable key is rejected with exit **2** and a message pointing at `unity config list`. `--format json` returns `{key, value}` for `get`/`set`, `{key, cleared}` for `unset`, and `{entries: [{key, value, writable}, …]}` for `list`.

### Context — named sets of the five defaults

The CLI keeps five defaults, each normally set by its own command: the active account (`auth switch`), the default organization (`cloud org set-default`), the default cloud project (`cloud project set-default`), the default editor (`editors default`) and the install path (`install-path`). A **context** is a name for one combination of all five, so moving between two setups is one command instead of five in the right order.

```bash
# Record the current five settings under a name
unity context save work

# Apply them again later — all five, or none
unity context use work

# What exists, and which one is currently in effect
unity context list
unity context current

# Forget one (the settings it named are left as they are)
unity context delete work
```

Names may use letters, digits, dots, dashes and underscores, up to 64 characters, and are matched case-insensitively — re-saving an existing name overwrites it in place.

**Applying is all-or-nothing.** The account, editor and install path are validated before anything is written; the organization and project are then checked against Unity Cloud under the account the context selects. Any failure names the missing item, exits **6**, and leaves every setting exactly as it was — a context pinning an editor you have since uninstalled fails with that editor's version rather than half-switching.

**A context clears what it does not pin.** Switching to a context that names no organization clears the organization rather than leaving the previous one's behind. The one exception is the account: there is no "signed in as nobody", so a context naming no account leaves the active one alone (and `unity context current` will still match such a context whoever is signed in).

**Offline and signed-out still work.** When Unity Cloud cannot be reached the stored organization and project are applied as-is and a warning says they were not verified, rather than the switch being refused.

`unity context use` reports every setting with a `*` against the ones that changed. The `setting` values are stable machine tokens — `account`, `organization`, `project`, `editor`, `install-path` — in every format, human included, so a script can key on them. Only `unity context list`'s column *headers* are translated.

Two name collisions worth knowing: this is unrelated to `unity build --profile`, which names a Unity Build Profile asset; and inside `unity shell`, bare `context` still prints that session's own ephemeral project/org selection, while `context <subcommand>` reaches this group.

### Hub — install the Unity Hub application

Bootstrap Unity Hub on a clean machine from the command line.

```bash
# Install the latest stable Hub for the current OS + architecture
unity hub install

# Install a specific Hub version
unity hub install --hub-version 3.17.0

# Force reinstall even when Hub is already detected
unity hub install --force

# Run the installer silently (Windows only)
unity hub install --headless

# Override architecture (e.g. x64 Hub on Apple Silicon via Rosetta)
unity hub install --architecture x64

# Skip the installer code-signature check (unsigned/local builds — not recommended)
unity hub install --skip-signature-check
```

Options: `-f` / `--force`, `--headless` (silent installer, Windows only), `-a` / `--architecture x64|arm64` (env `UNITY_ARCHITECTURE`), `--hub-version <version>` (default latest), `--skip-signature-check`.

**Integrity & signature verification** — every download is checked against the SHA-512 from the HTTPS manifest, then the installer's **code signature** is verified before it runs with elevation: on macOS via `codesign` (signer `Developer ID Application: Unity Technologies`), on Windows via Authenticode (signer subject `Unity Technologies`), checked *before* the UAC prompt. Verification is **fail-closed** — if it fails or the verifier is unavailable, the command aborts with exit 6 and does not run the installer. Linux `.AppImage` has no standard verifier, so it is SHA-512-only. Pass `--skip-signature-check` to bypass (prints a warning; not recommended).

**`--hub-version` behaviour** — fetches the version-specific manifest from the CDN; if that version does not exist, the command exits with code 6 (no fallback to latest).

```bash
# JSON output
unity hub install --format json
```

Emits `{ "success": true, "command": "hub install", "data": { "version": "3.x.x", "installed": true } }` on success, or an `{ "alreadyInstalled": true, "installedPath": "…" }` payload when Hub was already present.
